### Prior Data Projects ðŸ“Š
- [Minneapolis State of Public Housing](https://medium.com/@getprelease/minneapolis-state-of-rental-housing-sorh-rent-control-open-housing-data-report-73d38a557ab7)) : I used parcel data and rental licensing data to provide insights in the rental market. The report is part of the [PreLease Open Housing Initiative](https://github.com/PreLease/community-data-reports/tree/859c1769ed0877f465a0b38a6ce6f9a98e9c4999)
- I'm the founder of the [St. Paul Open Data Initiative](https://github.com/sustainabu/OpenData_Saint_Paul/blob/master/ActiveReports.md). The community reports covered public safety, education, voter turnout, and crime within Saint Paul.
